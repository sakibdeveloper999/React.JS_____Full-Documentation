## 📘 About

A curated 30-day curriculum for learning React.js — each day focuses on one concept with examples, exercises and a short mini-project. Designed for people with **basic HTML/CSS and JS** knowledge.

This repo is ideal for self-study, pair study, or teaching in a bootcamp/class.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/reactjs-30-days.git
   cd reactjs-30-days
   ```
2. Navigate to any day folder (every day contains its own package.json / starter when needed):

   ```bash
   cd Day01_React_Introduction
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. Tip: use `npx create-react-app` or `npm create vite@latest` to scaffold a fresh starter app in any day folder if you prefer Vite.
